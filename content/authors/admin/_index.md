I am a curious individual, particularly interested in various Machine Learning techniques and their implementations. I am looking forward to applying mathematical theoretical results in practice and learning to communicate my findings efficiently with people who may not have technical knowledge. A Data Science role requires many skills I strive to master, and therefore, this is the career I am courageously pursuing. 

Staying motivated and open-minded, I constantly seek opportunities for further personal development. I believe that positive change originates in the firm and well-rounded character, and by improving yourself as a human being, you impact the broader community, which as a result, leads to meaningful experiences.
